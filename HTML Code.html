<h2>
<u>Learning HTML</u>
</h2> <!-- Title (This is a comment) -->

<h3>
Introduction:
</h3> 

<p>
On the 5th of July 2022 during Computer Science class, my friend <em>Ruben</em> introduced me to HTML after creating a small
joke website about selling a <del>friend</del> classmate of ours called <em>Harvey</em>. 
</p>

<h3>
Day 1:
</h3>

<p>
Today is 05/07/2022 and I am at home writing this Day 1 paragraph. So far, i've learnt:
</p> 

<ul style=list-style-type:square;> <!-- Bullet Point Style (Square) -->

<li>The basic Syntax (Starting each element with greaterthan/equal too with element in between and ending it with an additional dash instead)</li>
<li>Structure of text (head, title, body, paragraphs(p) etc)</li>
<li>Chaning the type of letters ("strong" for <strong>bold</strong>, "em" for <em>itallics</em> and "u" for <u>underline</u></li>
<li>How to change elements color (using numbers like <q>rgb(255, 0, 128 etc)</q>)</li>
<li>How to make lists (using li to either use disc or square to bullet point etc)</li>

</ul>

<p>
I hope that by Day 3 I'll be confident with the basics and move onto using hyperlinks, buttons and changing fonts to make my work more presentable.
</p>

<h3>
Day 2:
</h3>

<p>
Today is 06/07/2022 and I am yet again at home writing this. Today i've been learning:
</p>

<ul style=list-style-type:square;> <!-- Bullet Point Style (Square) -->

<li>How to insert hyperlinks ("a" to define link and "href" is variable which has hyperlink)</li>
<li>How to insert images ("src" aka source is the variable which contains the image link + width, height)</li>
<li>Styling with color (starts with "p" then "style" followed by "color:blue;")</li>

</ul>

<p>
I am learning HTML using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3school's Official Website</a>.
</p>
<p style="color:rgb(0,0,255);">
For example, this paragraph is blue. After writing Day 2, I will begin to learn how to add tables and UI (e.g., buttons).
</p>

<h3>
Day 3:
</h3>

<p>
It has been a while since I last did HTML and I am now back again learning on the 10/07/2022. Last time I promised myself that I'll learn to add tables and different sorts of UI buttons etc. In addition, I would like to make this HTML document look better by perhaps changing the standard font.
</p>

<h4>Table review of what i've learnt so far:</h4>

<table style="%100">
	
    <th>Learnt</th>
	<th>Date</th>
	
	<tr>
    	<td>Basic Syntax of HTML</td>
		<td>05/07/2022</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
    	<td>Hyperlinks, images and color visuals</td>
        <td>06/07/2022</td>
	</tr>

</table>

<h3>
Day 4:
</h3>

<p>
It is the 11/07/2022, and I regret not learning enough HTML on day 3. Todays focus is to learn more styling and making my code look cleaner.
</p>

<table style="%100">
	
    <th>Completeted Today</th>
	
	<tr>
    	<td>More styling e.g., Changing Font, Color etc</td>
		
	</tr>

    	<td>How to format HTML code e.g., Not using capital letters</td>
        
	</tr>

	</tr>
    <tr>
    	<td>Tidying up my HTML code in order to be easier to read and edit in future </td>

<h3>
Day 5 - Testing Myself:
</h3>

<p>
Today is 14/07/2022, and i've learnt a fair bit of HTML. I believe it is time for me to test myself using the w3schools HTML practice questions.
